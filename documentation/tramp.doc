TRAMP: a program to  trace rays in  2-D media for  rapid forward
        modeling of refraction  and reflection travel  times and
        amplitudes

                        Program Description

  A 2-D (x,z) isotropic medium is assumed. The velocity  model is
composed  of  a  sequence  of   layers  separated  by  boundaries
consisting of  linked  linear segments  of  arbitrary dip.  Layer
boundaries must  cross  the  model  from  left  to  right.  Layer
thicknesses may be reduced to zero to model pinchouts or isolated
bodies. The velocity within a layer is defined by velocity values
specified at arbitrary x-coordinates along the  top and bottom of
the layer. The x-coordinates at which  layer boundaries and upper
and lower velocities are specified can  be completely general and
independent within and  between layers.  Velocity discontinuities
across layer  boundaries are  allowed but  not required.  For the
purposes of ray tracing, the model is automatically broken up into
an irregular network of  trapezoids, each with  dipping upper and
lower  boundaries  and  vertical   left  and  right   sides.  The
velocities at  the four  corners  of the  trapezoid  are used  to
interpolate a  velocity field  within the  trapezoid so  that the
velocity  varies  linearly  along  its   four  sides.  Therefore,
horizontal as well as vertical velocity gradients may exist within
a trapezoid. A simulation of smooth  layer boundaries is possible
in which the incident and emergent ray angles are calculated using
the slope of the smoothed boundary.
  The source(s) may be positioned anywhere in the model  and rays
may be directed any angle. The receivers are always assumed to be
at the top of  the model. Both  P- and S-wave  propagation can be
considered including (multiple)  conversions. A  unique Poisson's
ratio may be assigned to each trapezoid  of the model. Refracted,
reflected and head waves may be  traced, each possibly containing
multiple and/or surface reflections and conversions. Ray take-off
angles are determined automatically by the  program for those ray
groups specified by the user using an iterative shooting/bisection
search mode. Ray tracing is performed  by numerically solving the
ray tracing equations for 2-D media, a pair of first order ODE's,
using a Runge Kutta method. The ray  step length is automatically
adjusted at each  step to  maximize efficiency  while maintaining
accuracy. Travel  times are  calculated by  numerical integration
along ray  paths using  the  trapezoidal rule.  Travel times  and
amplitudes are linearly  interpolated to the  observed seismogram
locations since two-point ray tracing is not used.  A plot of the
model and all rays  traced may be  produced along with  a plot of
reduced  travel  time  versus  distance   for  the  observed  and
calculated data as well as other plots.
  The  amplitudes  of  refracted  and  reflected  rays,  possibly
multiply reflected and/or converted, are  calculated according to
zero-order  asymptotic  ray  theory.   The  in-plane  geometrical
spreading is evaluated  by fitting  a cubic  spline to  the curve
defined by range  versus take-off angle  for each ray  group. The
amplitudes  of  head  waves  are   calculated  using  first-order
asymptotic ray theory assuming  the layer along the  top of which
the wave  propagates  has  zero  vertical velocity  gradient.  An
explosive source  with  uniform  directional  characteristics  is
assumed. Both  P- and  S-wave Q  values may  be assigned  to each
model layer and/or block to allow for an approximate Q attenuation
calculation. The receivers  may represent vertical  or horizontal
component geophones.
  The model parameterization is  specifically suited to  modeling
crustal refraction/reflection data  since realistic  earth models
can be represented by a minimum number of model parameters, i.e.,.
the number and position of parameters specifying each layer can be
adapted to a data set's particular subsurface ray coverage. Layer
boundaries,  including  the  surface,  may   be  horizontal  (one
parameter) or consist of numerous straight line segments. A layer
may have  a constant  velocity  (one parameter)  or the  velocity
structure may be defined  by many upper and  lower layer velocity
points. Different  velocity  points may  be  specified above  and
below a layer  boundary if  a velocity discontinuity  is required
across the boundary, or  a single row  of velocity points  may be
specified if an interface with no discontinuity is needed.

                              Files

Executable file: TRAMP

Input file: r.in contains program input parameters in five parts:
   (1) the PLTPAR namelist contains arameters related to plotting
   (2) the AXEPAR namelist contains parameters related to axes
   (3) the  TRAPAR namelist  contains parameters  related  to ray
   tracing
   (4)  the  AMPPAR  namelist  contains   parameters  related  to
   amplitudes
   (5) after skipping three lines (column headings), the velocity
   model is specified as follows:
     (a) the  layer number,  the x-coordinates  (km)  of a  layer
        boundary entered  from  left to  right  (format: I2,  1X,
        10F7.2)
     (b) the z-coordinates (km) of a layer boundary corresponding
        to the x-coordinates listed above (format: 3X, 10F7.2)
     (c) a blank line
     (d) the layer number, the  x-coordinates (km) of the  points
        at which the  upper layer  velocity is  specified entered
        from left to right (format: I2, 1X, 10F7.2)
     (e) the upper layer  P-wave velocities (km/s)  corresponding
        to the x-coordinates listed above (format: 3X, 10F7.2)
     (f) a blank line
     (g) the layer number, the  x-coordinates (km) of the  points
        at which the  lower layer  velocity is  specified entered
        from left to right (format: I2, 1X, 10F7.2)

        to the x-coordinates listed above (format: 3X, 10F7.2)
     (i) a blank line
  The above sequence  of nine lines  is repeated  for each model
   layer, the  top-most layer  specified  first, the  bottom-most
   last, and is ended by specifying the  bottom layer boundary of
   the model as  in (a) and  (b) above.  If the number  of points
   defining a boundary or the upper or  lower velocity of a layer
   must exceed 10 then the points can be continued onto subsequent
   lines of the  file as  follows: line  (b), (e)  or (h)  of the
   particular parameter to be extended is modified to include a 1
   in the second column so the complete format of the line becomes
   I2, 1X, 10F7.2. The sequence of three lines (a)-(c), (d)-(f) or
   (g)-(i) is then repeated  as many times as  is necessary using

iroute - equals 1 to plot to the screen, 2 to create a postscript
   file, 3 to create a plot file for the VERSATEC plotter, or 4
   to create a colour postscript file; if iroute does not equal 1
   there is no plotting to the screen  (default: 1)

iseg - create a Uniras segment(s) (default: 0)

   velocty contours; the isovelocity contours join points of equal
   velocity at  the  minimum depth  at  which it  occurs  at any
   particular x-coordinate; therefore, low-velocity zones will not
   be contoured; the isovelocity contours are output to the file
   m.out if idump=1 (default: 0)

   (1) or symbols of height symht (2); no calculated travel times
   are plotted if itx=0 (default: 1)

idata - plot the  observed travel times  from the file  tx.in with
   the calculated travel times; the observed data are represented
   by vertical  bars with  a  height of  twice  the corresponding
   uncertainty included in the file tx.in (default: 0)

isep - plot the model and rays and travel times in the same plot
   frame (0), separate plot frames (1), or plot the model and rays
   in separate plot frames for each shot followed by the travel times
   in a single plot frame all shots (3) (default: 0)
   Note: the value of isep may be changed during a program run with
         entry from the keyboard of the values 0, 1, or 3 between
         plot frames when a <CR> is needed to continue; entering "s"
         will terminate the program run

iszero - plot the calculated and observed  travel times as if all
   shot points were at 0 km and  the rays traveled left to right
   (default: 0)

itxout - write the  calculated travel time-distance  pairs to the
   file tx.out;  the  integer  code  identifying  each  pick  is
   determined by the array ibreak; itx=1 or 2 must be used
   (default: 0)

iamout -  write the  calculated amplitude-distance  pairs  to the
   file amp.out;  the  integer  code  identifying  each  pick is

   output to the file m.out if idump=1 (default: 0)

ivzp - plot  all velocity-depth profiles  in a single  plot frame
   (default: 1)

ivrms -  plot  the RMS  velocity  of the  model  versus distance,
   ivrms=1 for P-wave velocity, ivrms=-1 fro S-wave velocity; the
   RMS velocity profile is  output to the  file m.out if  idump=1
   (default:: 0)

igrid - output the  velocity model sampled  on a uniform  grid to
   the file m.out; igrid=1 for P-wave velocity, igrid=2 for P-wave
   velocity gradient, igrid=-1 for S-wave velocity, igrid=-2 for
   S-wave  velocity  gradient,  igrid=-3   for  Poisson's  ratio
   (default: 0)

idump  -   write  detailed   velocity  model   and   ray  tracing
   information to  the file  r2.out  and the  namelist parameter
   values to the file n.out; mainly for debugging (default: 0)

   velocity model to the screen and to the file r1.out (default:
   1)

istep - pause after each ray is plotted writing its take-off angle
        to the screen and waiting until a <CR> is entered before
        plotting the next ray; this is intended to be used in
        conjunction with irays=1 to determine the cause of the

3) Ray tracing parameters (TRAPAR namelist):

ishot - an array specifying the directions rays are to be
traced
 from the shot points listed in the arrays xshot and zshot; the
  following code is used:
   (1) 0 - no rays are traced
   (2) -1 - rays are traced to the left only
   (3) 1 - rays are traced to the right only
   (4) 2 - rays are traced to the left and right
   (default: 0)

iraysl - use the  array irayt to  select which ray  groups listed
   in the array ray are to be traced for a particular shot point
   (default: 0)

irayt - an array selecting  those ray groups listed  in the array
   ray which are active for a particular shot point listed in the
   arrays xshot and zshot.  If there are n  ray groups listed  in
   the array ray,  then the  jth ray group  for the  ith shot is
   referred to in  the ((n-1)*i+j)th element  of irayt (default:
   1)

ifast - use a Runge-Kutta routine without error control to solve
   the ray tracing equations and a look-up/interpolation routine
   to evaluate certain trigonometric functions; with ifast=0, a
   Runge-Kutta method with error control and the intrinsic
   trigonometric functions are used. Using ifast=1 is about 30-40%
   faster and provides essentially the same accuracy as ifast=0
   (default: 1)
   Note: ifast=1 is intended to be used for all routine modelling
         and ifast=0 only to test a final model or if ifast=1
         obviously fails

iturn - an array  corresponding to the  ray groups listed  in the
   array ray to trace  rays only to  their turning or  reflection
   point in the search mode; if a refracted or head wave ray group
   is to contain a reflection(s) before it turns (specified using
   nrbnd and rbnd), then iturn=0 must be used (default: 1)

isrch - search again  for the take-off  angles of a  ray group if
   the same ray code is listed more than once for the same shot in
   the array ray; isrch=1 must be used if the take-off angles of
   two or more ray  groups with the same  ray code are  different
   because of multiple reflections and/or conversions specified by
   nrbnd, rbnd, ncbnd,and cbnd (default: 0)

istop - stop  tracing any  ray which reflects  off a  boundary not
   specified in the arrays ray or rbnd; if istop=2, rays are also
   stopped if they enter a layer deeper than that specified by the
   ray code in the array ray, i.e., the layer number is greater
   than L and the ray code is L.n, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3
   (default: 1)

ibsmth - apply  a simulation  of smooth  layer boundaries  (1) or
   apply the  simulation and  plot  the smoothed  boundaries (2);
    ibsmth=2 cannot be used if isep>1 (default: 0)

imodf - use the velocity  model in the file v.in  instead of the
   model in part (3) of the file r.in (default: 0)

b) Other ray tracing parameters:

xshot - an  array containing  the x-coordinates  (km) of the  shot
   points (default: xmin, for the first element only)

zshot - an  array containing  the z-coordinates  (km) of the  shot
   points (default: a very small distance below the model surface)

ray -  an  array  containing the  ray  groups  to be  traced;  the
   following code is used:
   (1) L.1 - rays which refract (turn) in the Lth layer
   (2) L.2 - rays which reflect off the bottom of the Lth layer
   (3) L.3 -  rays which  travel as  head waves along  the bottom
   of the Lth layer
   (4) L.0  - ray  take-off angles  supplied by  the user  in the
   arrays amin and amax

nray - an  array containing the  number of rays  to be  traced for
   each ray group  in the  array ray  (default: 10;  however, the
   default is the first element of nray for all ray groups if only
   one value is specified)

space - an array which  determines the spacing of  take-off angles
   between the minimum and  maximum values for each  ray group in
   the array  ray.  For  space=1,  the  take-off  angles will  be
   equally spaced;  for  space>1,  the  take-off angles  will  be
   concentrated  near  the  minimum  value;  for  0<space<1,  the
   take-off angles will  be concentrated  near the  maximum value
   (default: 1;  however, space=2  for a  reflected ray  group if
   specified as L.2 in the array ray)

amin, amax  -  arrays  containing  minimum  and  maximum  take-off
   angles  (degrees);  measured  from  the  horizontal,  positive
   downward and negative upward (for rays traveling left to right
   or right to left); used for ray groups in which ray=1.0

nsmax -  an array  containing the  maximum number  of rays  traced
   when searching for the take-off angles of the ray groups in the
   array ray  (default: 10;  however,  the default  is  the first
   element of  nsmax for  all  ray groups  if only  one  value is
   specified)

crit - head waves are generated if a down-going  ray in the search
   mode has an angle of incidence at the  bottom of the Lth layer
   within  crit  degrees  of  the  critical  angle  when  ray=L.3
   (default: 1)

hws - the spacing (km) of rays emerging upward  from the bottom of
   the Lth layer when ray=L.3 (default: (xmax-xmin)/25)

   emerge (default: 20)

dbnd - an array  containing the layers  along the bottom  of which
   diffracted waves are to be generated  if a downward travelling
   ray  intersects  the   lower  layer  boundary;   each  element
   corresponds to the ray groups in the array ray; the spacing of
   emerging rays along the boundary is hws  (km) and the angle of
   emergence equals the angle of incidence of the generating ray;
   the velocity  of  propagation along  the  boundary equals  the
   velocity directly beneath  the boundary; amplitudes  cannot be
   calculated for this type of ray

aamin - minimum  take-off angle  (degrees) for  the refracted  ray
   group in the first layer (default: 5)

aamax - maximum take-off angle (degrees) for  reflected ray groups
   specified as L.2 in the array ray (default: 85)

stol - if a ray traced in  the search mode is of the  correct type
   and its  end point  is within  stol (km)  of the  previous ray
   traced in the search mode, then the search for that ray type is
   terminated; a value of stol=0 will ensure  that nsmax rays are
   always traced in the search mode (default: (xmax-xmin)/3500)

nrbnd - an  array containing the  number of  reflecting boundaries
   for each ray group in the array ray (default: 0)

rbnd - an array containing the reflecting  boundaries specified in
   the array nrbnd; the following code is used:
   (1) L -  ray traveling  downward is  reflected upward  off the
   bottom of the Lth layer
   (2) -L -  ray traveling upward  is reflected downward  off the
   top of the Lth layer

ncbnd - an array containing the number of converting (P  to S or S
   to P) boundaries for each ray group in the array ray (default:
   0)

cbnd - an array containing the converting  boundaries specified in
   the array ncbnd; the following code is used:
   (1) i   - ray will  convert from its  present wave type  (P or
   S) at the ith layer boundary encountered
   (2) 0 - ray will leave the source as an S-wave

pois - an array containing  the value of Poisson's ratio  for each
   model layer; a  value of  0.5 signifies  a water layer  with a
   corresponding  S-wave   velocity  of   zero   (default:  0.25;
   however, the  default is  the first  element of  pois  for all
   layers if only one value is specified)

poisl, poisb -  arrays specifying  the layers  and block  numbers,
   respectively, of model trapezoids within which Poisson's ratio
   is modified over that given by pois using the array poisbl; for
   poisb, the trapezoids with  a layer are numbered  from left to
   right

poisbl - an array containing the value of Poisson's  ratio for the
   model trapezoids  specified  in  the  arrays poisl  and  poisb
   overriding the values assigned using the array pois

npbnd  -  number  of  points  at  which  each  layer  boundary  is
   uniformly sampled  for smoothing  if ibsmth=1  or  2 (default:

   tracing equations according to the relationship

             step length (km) = step*v/(|vx|+|vz|)

  where   v   is  velocity   and   vx   and  vz   are   its   partial
   derivatives with respect to x and z (default: 0.05)

smin, smax -  minimum and maximum  allowable ray step  length (km)
   (default: (xmax-xmin)/4500 and (xmax-xmin)/15)

4) Amplitude parameters (AMPPAR namelist):

a) Switches  (usually 0 = off, 1 = on):

iamp  -  calculate  ray  theoretical   amplitudes  if  iamp=1  or
   calculate amplitudes  and plot  amplitude-distance  curves if
   iamp=2 (default: 0)

isect - calculate the  time, amplitude and phase  of each arrival
   of the  synthetic  sections by  interpolating  the  calculated
   travel time- and amplitude-distance curves and write these to
   the file sect.out for input to the plotting program PLTSYN; the
   seismogram locations are specified by xmins, xmaxs and xincs if
   isect=1 or contained in the  file rec.in if isect=2 (default:
   0)

ibreak - an array corresponding  to the ray groups  listed in the
   array ray to split into prograde and retrograde segments when
   (1) plotting travel time- and ampltude-distance curves (itx=1),
   (2) fitting cubic splines to the range versus take-off angle values
   to evaluate the in-plane spreading,  and (3) interpolating to
   obtain an arrival at  a seismogram location  if isect=1 or  2;
   also to increment the integer code  by one in the file tx.out
   when changing from a  prograde to retrograde  segment or vice
   versa if itxout=1 (default: 1)

iint - an  array corresponding  to the  ray groups  listed in  the
   array ray  to  use  all arrivals  in  a  particular ray  group
   regardless or  their calculated  ray code  when (1)  fitting a
   cubic spline  to the  range  versus take-off  angle  values to
   determine the  in-plane spreading,  and  (2) interpolating  to
   calculate the arrivals of the  synthetic sections; iint=0 will
   ensure that  cubic  splines  will  involve  rays  of the  same
   calculated ray code and  that interpolation will  be performed
   across two successive arrivals of the  same ray code (default:
   0)

icaust -  add a 90 degree phase  shift  to  a  retrograde  branch  of
   refracted arrivals  (ray code  L.1) to  represent  the passage
   through a single caustic (default: 1)

icomp - seismometer type: icomp=1 for  vertical component, icomp=0
   for horizontal component (default: 1)

icmp - measure  the receiver  locations with  respect to the  shot
   points (positive to the right, negative to the left) and output
   the mid-point  and  half-offset  of  each  trace  to the  file
   sect.out; icmp=0 will ensure that  the receivers are specified
   with respect to model distance if iszero=0, or with respect to
   the shot  points  and  the  directions  specified  by  idr  if
   iszero=1 (default: 0)

iden - convert the  velocity model to constant-density  blocks and
   output to  the  file  m.out for  use  as  input  to a  gravity
   modelling program (default: 0)

surcon - calculate  the surface  conversion coefficient  (default:
   1)

amprev - calculate the amplitudes of refracted  and reflected rays
   in the reverse direction  to which they  were traced (default:
   0)

b) Other amplitude parameters:

ampsmt - number of applications, N, of a  3-point smoothing filter
   to amplitude curves is given by

                         N = ampsmt (n-2)

   where n is  the number of  arrivals in  the corresponding
   cubic spline used  to determine  the in-plane  spreading for
   refracted and reflected ray groups, or the number of arrivals in
   the ray group for a head wave ray group; this smoothing can be
   used  to remove some of  the artificial highs and lows often
   associated with ray amplitudes (default: 0.1)

spamp -  ratio of  S-wave  to P-wave  displacement  at the  source
   (default: 1)

   (g/cm3), where

  r  = denc(1) + denc(2)vp + denc(3)vp2 + denc(4)vp3 + denc(5)vp4;

   if poisson's ratio equals  0.5, the material is  assumed to be
   water and  r=1.0; this  relationship fits  empirical  data for
   1<vp<9 (default: -.6997, 2.2302, -.598, .07036, -.0028311)

denmin  -  minimum  density  (g/cm3)  for   a  non-water  material
   (default: 1.25)

ncaust - an array to  add a phase shift equal  to 90x(ncaust) degrees
   to the ray groups in the array ray (default: 0)

omega  -  dominant  fequency   (Hz)  used  in  calculation   of  Q
   attenuation and head wave amplitudes (default: 5)

hedcut -  the amplitude  of  all head  waves  that have  travelled
   along the head wave boundary less than  Hmin (km) will have an
   amplitude equal to that ray which travelled exactly Hmin along
   the boundary where Hmin equals hedcut  percentage of the first
   head wave  of the  group, i.e.,  the minimum-range  head wave;
   hedcut is used to avoid an infinite  amplitude at the critical
   point predicted by asymptotic ray theory (default: 25)

qp,  qs  -  arrays  containing   the  P-  and  S-wave   Q  values,
   respectively, for each layer  of the velocity  model (default:
   infinite, infinite; however, the default  is the first element
   of qp (or qs) for all layers if only one value is specified)

ql,  qb  -  arrays  containing  the  layers   and  block  numbers,
   respectively, of  model  trapezoids within  which  the P-  and
   S-wave Q values are modified over that given by qp and qs using
   the array qpbl first, followed by qsbl

qpbl, qsbl  -  arrays  containing  the  P- and  S-wave  Q  values,
   respectively, for model trapezoids specified  by the arrays ql
   and qb overriding the values assigned using  the arrays qp and
   qs

xmins, xmaxs  -  minimum  and  maximum seismogram  location  (km),
   respectively,  if   isect=1   (default:   xmin+(xmax-xmin)/50,
   xmax-(xmax-xmin)/50)

xincs   -   seismogram   spacing   (km)   if   isect=1   (default:
   (xmaxs-xmins)/48)

                         Additional Notes

Array defaults: if  a single  default value is  indicated for  an
   array parameter, all elements of the array  have that default
   value.

Layer boundaries: must begin at xmin and end at xmax even  if the
   layer above and/or below is pinched out  (unless the boundary
   is defined by only one point, then it is specified at xmin).

Bottom layer boundary: should consist of at most ten points.

Near-vertical layer boundaries:  should be  avoided because  they
   may result in large velocity gradients  nearby. If necessary,
   the adjacent trapezoids should have zero velocity gradient.

Shot point locations: may be anywhere in the model,  but locating
   them directly on a model boundary may cause problems.

Ray group: is defined as a set of rays specified by a ray code in
   the  array  ray,   possibly  modified  to   include  multiple
   reflections and/or  conversions,  whose take-off  angles  are
   determined by an  iterative search mode  or specified  by the
   user using ray=1.0 and the arrays amin and amax.

Zero velocity gradient: if the four corner velocities of  a model
   trapezoid are equal, then  there is a zero  velocity gradient
   inside and no  ray bending  will occur.  It is preferable  to
   have a zero gradient in all or part of a  layer rather than a
   very small gradient  so that the  Runge Kutta routine  can be
   avoided and straight ray paths are used.

Large velocity gradients: ray  tracing becomes inaccurate if  the
   velocity gradient is  large and  the ray  step length is  not
   small enough. In this case a warning message is given and the
   value of smin and/or step should be reduced.

Ray code:  listed in  the  file r1.out  for  each ray  traced  is
   supplied as an internal check to ensure that the correct rays
   specified in the array ray  or the arrays amin and  amax have
   been traced. This  ray code is  determined by the  program as
   follows: the number to the left of the decimal  refers to the
   deepest layer encountered by the ray; the number to the right
   of the decimal will be one, unless (1) the  ray was reflected
   upward from a layer boundary, in which case it will be two, or
   (2) the ray traveled as a head wave, in which case it will be
   three (assuming the ray was not reflected upward from a layer
   boundary after traveling as a head wave).

Shot point located at depth: in  this case, the array ray  should
   not contain ray codes corresponding to layers  above the shot
   point.

Ray step length:  a very small  value of step  may not result  in
   increased ray tracing accuracy due to round-off error

Ray changes direction: a ray traveling left to right  can reflect
   or refract and change direction and travel right  to left, or
   vice versa.

Terminating a ray:  if istop=0,  a ray  will be  traced until  it
   encounters the top, bottom, left or right of the model, unless
   it is reflected off the top of the model using nrbnd and rbnd.

Ray stopped warning: the warnings  which begin ray stopped -  are
   included in  the  file  r1.out  directly before  the  summary
   information for that ray is listed.

Failure of ray  search mode:  it is possible  that the  iterative
   shooting/bisection algorithm used in the ray  search mode may
   fail, or find  a limited range  of take-off angles  that only
   sample a part of a  layer, if either (1) the  model has large
   lateral variations, (2) the range of take-off angles defining
   the desired ray group is very small, (3) the value of nsmax is
   too small or stol is too large, or (4) it  is not possible to
   trace the desired type of  rays through a particular  part of
   the model (i.e., violates Snell's law). In any case, increase
   the value of nsmax first and then decrease the  value of stol
   if necessary and this should work (unless the problem is case
   4). If this fails,  take-off angles can be  supplied manually
   using ray=1.0 and  the arrays amin  and amax. Use  irays=1 to
   see why the search mode is failing.

Travel  time-  and  amplitude-distance  curves:  join  successive
   points of the same ray  code in the same ray  group. Prograde
   and retrograde branches will be separated if ibreak=1.

Ray  search  mode  and  multiple  reflections:  for   ray  groups
   specified by  L.2  in  the  array ray,  the  take-off  angles
   determined in the search  mode will correspond to  rays which
   reflect off the Lth  layer boundary only  and may or  may not
   give rise to the multiple reflections specified  by nrbnd and
   rbnd .

Integer code in the file tx.out: is used to identify  each travel
   time to allow  for the appropriate  comparison with  the rays
   traced  during  inversion.  It  will  begin  at   one  and  be
   incremented one for each ray group if  itxout=1. In addition,
   the integer will be  incremented by one  for a change  from a
   prograde to retrograde branch or vice versa if ibreak=1.

Laterally homogeneous  layer:  if  a  layer  boundary  is  to  be
   horizontal or the upper or lower velocity of a layer is to be
   constant, then only a single point is required in the velocity
   model and it should be specified at an  x-coordinate equal to
   xmin. If two or more points are required, then  the first and
   last point must be specified at xmin and xmax, respectively.

Constant  velocity  layer:  to  specify  a  layer  with  constant
   velocity, assign a  single upper layer  velocity at  xmin and
   assign a lower layer velocity of zero at xmin.

Zero vertical velocity  gradient layer: to  specify a layer  with
   zero vertical  velocity gradient,  assign one  or more  upper
   layer velocities as usual and assign a lower layer velocity of
   zero at xmin.

Zero velocity discontinuity across  layer boundary: to specify  a
   layer boundary  with  no associated  velocity  discontinuity,
   assign an upper layer velocity of zero at xmin  for the layer
   directly beneath the boundary.

Head waves:  if  the  velocity  contrast  across  the  head  wave
   boundary away from the critical point is zero or negative, the
   angle of emergence from the boundary is 90 degree (grazing). Head
   wave amplitudes will be incorrect if any part of the ray path
   contains a reflection or conversion.

In-plane spreading/cubic spline: a  non-head wave ray group  must
   consist of  at  least  two  rays to  calculate  the  in-plane
   spreading. The slope  of the cubic  spline used  to calculate
   the in-plane spreading may be sensitive to the number of rays
   traced for  a particular  ray group  if the  model has  large
   lateral variations; therefore, the number of rays traced will
   determine the amount of lateral heterogeneity that is sampled.

Q attenuation: is calculated at a single frequency, omega, and is
   applied    equally    at    all    frequencies,     i.    e.,
   frequency-independent attenuation;  therefore,  there  is  no
   waveform distortion due to dispersion.  This approximation is
   valid for narrow-band data or if the  total attenuation along
   any given ray path is not too large.


External plot routines: TRAMP is self-contained except  for the
   graphics calls inside the following CALCOMP or CALCOMP-like plot
   routines: PLOTS, PLOT, NUMBER, SYMBOL, LINE, EMPTY, ERASE, PLOTND.
   The file pltlib.f contains ALL these routines (and a few other
   less important ones used by the graphics system where the
   code was developed) and it will be necessary to replace the "call"
   statements within each of these with their equivalents in the
   local graphics package.

                           Array Sizes

                    Warning and Error Messages

The following is a list  and explanation of all possible  warning
and error messages generated by TRAMP:

*** error  in velocity  model ***  - an  error in  the format  of
   the velocity model in the file r.in or v.in has been detected.
   One of the following problems exists:
      (1) the  x-coordinates  of a  boundary  or upper  or  lower
         velocity have not been listed from left to right
      (2) the  x-coordinate  of the  first  or last  point  of  a
         boundary or upper or lower velocity (comprised of two or
         more points) does not equal xmin or xmax, respectively
      (3) a model block has a P-wave velocity less than or equal
         to zero
      (4) a line  specifying the  model (x-  or z-coordinates or
         upper or lower  velocity) or a  blank line  in the file
         r.in or  v.in  has  been  omitted  (i.e.,  the file  is
         incomplete)

*** array size error  for number of model  points *** - the  size
   of the arrays specifying the maximum number of points defining
   a layer boundary and/or the upper or lower  layer velocity is
   not a multiple of 10

*** maximum number of  blocks in layer _  exceeded *** - a  layer
   in the velocity model will  consist of more than  the maximum
   number of trapezoids  allowed for  a single  layer given  the
   current form  of  the  model.  Reduce the  number  of  points
   defining the upper and/or lower boundary or  velocity for the
   particular layer.

*** location of shot  point outside model ***  - a shot point  is
    located outside the model.

*** error  in specification  of  amin or  amax  *** -  values  of
   amin or amax have not been specified or are  greater than 180
   in absolute value.

*** max  reflecting  boundaries  exceeded  *** -  the  number  of
   reflecting boundaries in nrbnd  is greater than  that allowed
   for one or more ray groups.

*** max  converting  boundaries  exceeded  *** -  the  number  of
   converting boundaries in ncbnd  is greater than  that allowed
   for one or more ray groups.

*** reflecting  boundary  greater  than  #  of  layers  ***  -  a
   boundary in rbnd is  greater than or  equal to the  number of
   model layers.

*** no  ray  codes  specified  ***  -  no  ray  codes  have  been
   specified in the array ray.

*** shot# _  ray code  _ no  rays traced  *** -  the search  mode
   was unable  to find  rays for  the  shot point  and ray  code
   specified.

*** shot# _ ray  code _ 1  ray traced *** -  the search mode  was
   unable to find the maximum take-off angle of  a refracted ray
   group for the shot point and ray code specified; only a single
   ray with  a take-off  angle  equal to  the  minimum value  is
   traced.

*** less  than  nray rays  traced  for _  ray  groups ***  -  the
   search mode was unable to find rays (or traced less than nray
   rays) for the number of ray groups specified.

*** possible  inaccuracies  in  rngkta  ***  -  the  Runge  Kutta
   routine has detected possible inaccuracies in  its attempt to
   solve the ray tracing equations. The exact  point(s) at which
   the problem  occurred can  be  found in  the  file r2.out  if
   idump=1 is  used. The  problem  can be  eliminated by  either
   reducing the velocity gradient in the appropriate location of
   the model or reducing the value of step and/or smin.

*** ray stopped  - consists  of too many  points ***  - a ray  is
   composed of  more than  the  maximum number  of points  (step
   lengths) allowed. Tracing of this ray is terminated.

*** ray stopped  - intersected too  many boundaries ***  - a  ray
   intersected more than the maximum number  of model boundaries
   allowed. Tracing of this ray is terminated.

*** ray stopped -  illegal reflection ***  - a ray has  reflected
   off a  boundary not  specified in  ray or  rbnd and  istop=1.
   Tracing of this ray is terminated.

*** ray stopped - converted ray  cannot reflect/refract  *** -  a
   ray is at a point of conversion from S to P and is beyond the
   critical angle. Tracing of this ray is terminated.

***  ray  stopped  -  s-wave   cannot  propagate  ***  -  a   ray
   propagating as an S-wave has  entered a model block  in which
   the  S-wave  velocity  is  zero.  Tracing  of   this  ray  is
   terminated.

*** ray  stopped -  reflected  from pinchout    *** -  the  layer
   from which  a ray  is  to be  reflected  has zero  thickness.
   Tracing of this ray is terminated.

*** ray  refl.  from  zero  vel.  contrast  boundary  ***  -  the
   amplitude of a  ray reflected from  a zero  velocity contrast
   boundary has been set to zero. If ampsmt>0,  the amplitude of
   this ray may become greater than zero after smoothing.

*** ray attenuated  to zero amplitude  *** - the  amplitude of  a
   ray is zero because of large Q attenuation.  If ampsmt>0, the
   amplitude of  this ray  may  become greater  than zero  after
   smoothing.

*** block  undetermined ***  -  this is  the most  serious  error
    since it implies  that TRAMP  has lost  track of  what model
    block a ray is supposed to be in and therefore implies there
    is probably a bug in the code. The problem may be avoided if
    the ray  step  length  is  reduced.  Also  check that  layer
    boundaries do  not  cross  or  that  a  deeper  boundary  is
    specified before a  shallower boundary  in the  file r.in or
    v.in.

*** max  number  of rays  reaching  surface  exceeded ***  -  the
    maximum allowable number  of rays reaching  the surface (not
    including those traced in the search mode) has been reached.

*** problem with  cubic spline  *** - the  cublic spline  routine
    was unable to  fit a  spline to  the values of  range versus
    take-off angle, used in  determining the in-plane spreading,
    for a particular set  of.rays. The amplitudes  of these rays
    will be set to zero.

***  error  in  specification  of  seismogram  parameters  ***  -
    either (1) xmins is greater than or equal to xmaxs, (2) xincs
    is less than or  equal to zero,  or (3) the  total number of
    seismograms is less than one or greater than pseis.

*** rec.in  is  empty  ***  -  the  file  rec.in  containing  the
    seismogram locations is empty and isect=2.

*** too many  arrivals for seismogram  at _ km  *** - the  number
    of arrivals  for  the seismogram  specified  exceeds parriv.
    Only the first parriv  arrivals will be  written to the file
    sect.out.

                          Other Programs

PLTSYN: a program  to plot synthetic  seismic sections given  the
        source and trace locations  and the time,  amplitude and
        phase of each arrival as output by the program TRAMP

                       Program Description

   Given the time, amplitude  and phase of  each arrival, PLTSYN
plots the corresponding synthetic  seismic sections. The time  and
distance window, reduction velocity and sample rate are specified
by the user. The source wavelet may also be input by the user  or
there  are  two  default  wavelets.  The  trace  spacing  may  be
completely general. There  are three  types of amplitude  scaling
allowed: (1)  trace normalized,  (2) distance  corrected with  an
overall scale  factor  supplied  by  the user,  or  (3)  distance
corrected with an  overall scale factor  determined by PLTSYN.  A
time-saving feature  is available  whereby the  zero portions  of
traces, common in ray synthetics, are plotted as 2-point straight
line segments. The  time axis may  increase upwards or  downwards
and trace shading (aka "variable area") is  also possible.  A
constant velocity NMO correction may be applied.

                         Input Parameters

1) Plotting parameters (PLTPAR namelist):

a) Switches  (usually 0 = off, 1 = on):

iplot - generate the plot  during the run (1), or  write all plot
   commands to the file p.out (0), or do both (2); if iplot=-1,
   no plot is generated and no commands written to the file p.out
   (this option my be useful if iamp=1 and no plot is required)
    (default: 1)

iconv - convolve  impulse response with  source wavelet (default:
   1)

iwavlt - source  wavlet is  a 29-point low-passed  Ricker wavelet
   if iwavlt=0,  a single-cycle  sine  wave consisting  of nptsw
   points if iwavlt=1, or obtained from the file w.in if iwavlt=2
   (default: 0)

ipol -  reverses the  polarity  of the  source  wavelet (default:
   0)

iscale -  scale  all  traces to  a  common  maximum amplitude  if
   iscale=0, apply  a user-specifed  global  scale factor  and a
   distant correction factor if iscale=1, or apply a global scale
   factor determined by PLTSYN and a distance corrector factor if
   iscale=2 (default: 0)

ishade -  equals 1 for trace shading (default: 0)

ifill -  shade  the  positive  (ifill=1)  or negative  (ifill=-1)
   portion of the traces if ishade=1 (default: 1)

inmo -  apply a  constant RMS  velocity NMO  correction (default:
   0)

iamp - calculate the amplitude of the seimograms at the times
   specified in the file tx.out and output to amp.out; the
   x-coordinates of the traveltimes in tx.out must be equal to
   the x-coordinates of the seismograms (default: 0)

idump -  write the  constructed seismograms  to the  file syn.out
   (default: 0)

b) Other plotting parameters:

vred - reducing velocity  (km/s); vred need  not be equal  to the
   reducing velocity used  when running  TRAMP (a  zero value is
   permitted for  no  reduction;  vred  must  be  less  than 10)
   (default: 8)

sps - digitization rate in samples per second (default: 60)

nsmth - number of applications  of a 3-point smoothing filter  to
    the impulse response (default: 0)

scalef -  global  scale factor  applied  to  all traces  if  iscale=1
    (default: 100)

rcor - power of the distance correction factor if iscale=1  or 2;
    traces will be multiplied  by their source-receiver distance
    raised to the rcor power (default: 1)

xnorm - the  source-receiver distance  is divided  by xnorm  (km)
    before raising to the rcor power  if iscale=1 or 2 (default:
    100)

amp - maximum  amplitude of a  trace (km) if  iscale=0 or 2;  all
    traces are scaled to a maximum amplitude of amp if iscale=0;
    the scale factor scalef  is determined by  PLTSYN (and output to
    the sreen)  so  that  the maximum  amplitude  of  the entire
    section is amp if iscale=2; if amp  equals half of the trace
    spacing, no overlap will occur (default: (xmax-xmin)/100)

clip - the amplitude (km) at which clipping is done  if iscale=1;
    if clip=0, no clipping is done  (default: 0)

nptsw -  number  of  points  comprising  the  source  wavelet  if
    iwavlt=1  (default: 19)

nskip - plot every nskip seismogram  (default: 1)

spmin - zero portions of traces that are less than spmin  (km) in
    amplitude will be plotted as a single straight line segement
    consisting of two points to decrease  the plot time; a value
    of zero will  ensure that  all points  are plotted (default:
    (xmax-xmin)/100000)

xomit - an array containing the  locations (km) of traces not  to
    be plotted

dens -  points  per mm  for  trace shading  (default: 5)

   maximum and minimum values of the seismogram is calculated
   (default: 1)

twin - window length (s) following each arrival used if iamp=1
   (default: 0.25)

2) Axes parameters (AXEPAR namelist):

a) Switches  (usually 0 = off, 1 = on):

tmm - length of time axis (mm)
ttmin, ttmax - minimum and maximum values (s) of tick marks
ntickt - number of intervals separated by tick marks along time axis
ndecit - number of digits after decimal in time axis annotation;
   -1 for integer annotation (defaults: 0, 10, 125; values for
   ttmin, ttmax, ntickt and ndecit depend on values of tmin and tmax)

                         Additional Notes

User-specified source wavelet: contained in the file w.in will be
   adjusted to have zero mean and a maximum amplitude of one.


External plot routines: PLTSYN is self-contained except  for the
   graphics calls inside the following CALCOMP or CALCOMP-like plot
   routines: PLOTS, PLOT, NUMBER, SYMBOL, LINE, EMPTY, ERASE, PLOTND.
   The file pltlib.f contains ALL these routines (and a few other
   less important ones used by the graphics system where the
   code was developed) and it will be necessary to replace the "call"
   statements within each of these with their equivalents in the
   local graphics package.

                           Array Sizes

The parameters specifying the size of all arrays within PLTSYN are
contained in the  file pltsyn.par and  may be altered  to suit  a
particular problem and memory requirements.

arrivals in a single seismogram - parriv

seismograms - pseis

points comprising a single trace - ppseis

points comprising the source wavelet - pwavlt

                    Warning and Error Messages

The following  is a  list and  explanation of  warning and  error
messages generated by PLTSYN:

***  insufficient   data   in   sect.out  ***   -   a   premature
   end-of-file has been reached  in the file  sect.out, probably
   because the file is empty or there are  less lines containing
   arrivals than  specified  for one  or  more  traces (see  the
   description of the file sect.out).

*** w.in is  empty *** -  the file containing  the source  wavelt
   is empty and iwavlt=2

*** source  wavelet is  zero  *** -  the  source wavelet  in  the
   file w.in has zero maximum amplitude

*** max # of arrivals  exceeded on seismogram at  _ km *** -  the
   number of arrivals on the seismogram specified exceeds parriv.
   Edit the file sect.out to  reduce the number of  arrivals for
   this seismogram.

*** interpolated trace for shading too long ***  - the number  of
   points in the interpolated trace used for shading if ishade=1
   is greater than ppseis. Decrease the value of dens.

COMBSEC: a program  to combine  two sect.out  files generated  by
         TRAMP in two separate  runs into one  file of the  same
         format for use by PLTSYN

                              Files

Input file: sect1.in  is the  output file  sect.out generated  by
   TRAMP

Input file: sect2.in  is the  output file  sect.out generated  by
   TRAMP

Output file: sect.out  contains the  combined information in  the
   files sect1.in and  sect2.in in  the same  format for use  as
   input to the program PLTSYN

Note: the files sect1.in and sect2.in must have been generated by
    TRAMP using the same values of xmins, xmaxs and xincs (isect=1)
    or the same rec.in file (isect=2).
