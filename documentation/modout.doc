Within the Rayinvr Pltpar namelist, add the following line
of parameters (for example):

 modout=1, dxmod=5., dzmod=0.25, modi=1,2,5, xmmin=0., xmmax=260.,

modout - switch to out the model on a unifrom grid.
dxmod, dzmod - grid spacing in x and z directions
modi - sample these layer boundaries (counting from th top) and output
       them (spaced at dxmod) after the model in the output file
xmmin, xmmax - min and max x coord (can be different from xmin and xmax)
               note: zmin and zmax determine limits in z direction

Output file: "v.out". There are two header lines at the top containing,
xmmin, xmmax, zmin, zmax, zmin (again), dxmod, dzmod, and then on the
next line is the number of cells in the x and z directions (equals the number
of nodes-1). Then the model follows using the format:
10f10.3
The layer boundaries are preceeded by 3 header lines containing:
1. the number of boundaries output
2. the number of points
3. xmmin (once for each boundary)
Then the boundaries follow using the same format as for the model

Output file: "fort.35". An "x,y,z" file suitable for plotting using gmt.
first column is x position, second column is z position, third column
is velocity. 
 
note: using modout=2 and tracing rays will cause the v.out file to
have velocities of 9.999 where there is no ray coverage around the edges
of the model, and the fort.35 file will omit the unsampled nodes as well.
This allows plots of the model with the unsample portion of the model 
(around the edges) omitted. Also, fort.63 is a "x,y,z" file where
first column is x position, second column is z position, third column
is ray hits.
