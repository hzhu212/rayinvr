This directory contains the source codes for various utility programs
to be used with rayinvr, tramp, pltsyn, vmodel and rayplot. They are all
non-graphics fortran 77 codes with generally a very simple function
and the input and output files are generally obvious, but can be
determined by reading the comments at the top of each source code.
Some of the programs are documented in the documentation files for
rayinvr or tramp.

This is a list of the name and purpose of each program:

2PT:          Produce a bit-mask file using two output files generated
              by RAYINVR to allow a two-point minimum-traveltime raypath
              diagram to be produced by RAYPLOT (see documentation of
              RAYPLOT for details)

COMBINE:      Combine the partial derivatives and
              traveltime residuals from two runs

COMBSEC:      Combine two "sect.out" files into one

DMPLSTSQR:    Damped least-squares solution of
              traveltime inversion problem

FTEST:        Compute the significance of two given
              chi-squared values using the F-test

ISEIS:        Interpolate traveltime picks at
              uniform or specified seismogram locations

ORDER_PICKS:  Re-order "tx.in" file in order of
              increasing x-coordinate within each phase
              (use this program before running RECIPROCITY).

PHERCOUNT:    Calculate number of arrivals for each phase
              and average uncertainties for "tx.in" file

RECIPROCITY:  Check traveltime reciprocity of "tx.in" file
              (must run ORDER_PICKS before to order the tx.in file)

REDUCE:       Change the reducing velocity applied to a "tx.in" file

SECT2TX:      Obtain a "tx.in" file from a "sect.out" file

SMOOTHLSQR:   Least-squares solution of traveltime inversion problem
              using smoothing regularisation. It uses the same d.in file
              as DMPLSTSQR but dmpfct now controls the smoothing. You must
              invert for all parameters in a given row at the same time.

SMOOTH_PICKS: Smooth a "tx.in" file within each phase

SPREAD:       Select the receiver locations
              according to a specified geometry

TTNOISE:      Add Gaussian noise to traveltime picks

TX2POIS:      Calculate Poisson's ratio from P- and S-wave
              travel times in two separate tx.in files

TX2REC:       Obtain a "rec.in" file for input to TRAMP from
              a "tx.in" file

TXMATCH:      select picks with the same positions for two
              different phases from two "tx.in" files

TXOFFSET:     Convert a "tx.in" file with a shot at 0 km to a
              file with shots at any position

TXPHASE:      Select particular phases from a "tx.in" file

TXSHIFT:      Apply a bulk time shift to picks for selected
              shots in a "tx.in" file. This program is primarily
              intended to be used after running reciprocity
              which provides the bulk time shifts to minimize
              the reciprocal traveltime discrepancies.

UNC:          Assign an offset-dependent pick uncertainty

VDEPTH:       Apply a bulk shift to the z-coordinates of a v.in file

VDIFF:        Take the difference of two velocity models
              with the same parameterization

VEX:          Extrapolate the constrained part of a model
              to the edges of the model

VPOIS:        Calculate Poisson's ratio given the P- and
              and S-wave velocity models in 2 separate files

VS:           Convert a P-wave velocity model to an S-wave
              model using a constant Poisson's ratio

VZOOM:        Change the xmin and/or xmax of a velocity model

XSHOT:        Change the shot position and/or direction
              in a "tx.in" file
